# IF100 Computational Approaches to Problem Solving

* The course is an introduction to the key concepts in computational thinking such as algorithmic thinking, abstraction and decomposition. The students will also gain basic programming skills in order to apply computational thinking concepts in practice.

* Through the lectures, take-home exams, and interactive recitations specific to different disciplines, the students will learn how to design algorithms, how to divide a problem into subproblems, and how to build a solution by means of compositions. Evaluation of the solutions in terms of correctness and efficiency will also be covered.

* In order to enable students apply computational thinking skills in practice, basic programming concepts, such as variables, statements, conditionals, iteration, and functions will be introduced by using a simple programming language such as Python.
